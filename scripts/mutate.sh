# Mutation testing for the code where a wrong answer is a disclosure.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# A passing test suite says the code does something. It does not say the tests would
# notice if it stopped. Every security bug this project has shipped so far was under a
# green suite, and each was found by breaking the code on purpose:
#
#   - `a_mismatched_state_is_refused` passed because the OIDC flow died at a LATER nonce
#     check. Disabling the CSRF defence entirely failed no test.
#   - a forged-session test whose store held no principals, so any token would have failed
#     and the test asserted nothing about forgery.
#   - `an_anonymous_caller_reads_nothing` passed because no grant matched ANY subject, so
#     deleting the authentication check from the audit reader still passed.
#
# All three looked completely reasonable. Nothing but a mutation exposes them, so the
# mutations live here rather than in someone's shell history.
#
# HOW TO READ A RESULT
# --------------------
#   KILLED   the suite noticed. That is the pass condition.
#   SURVIVED the code was broken and every test still passed. Either the mutation is
#            genuinely equivalent — in which case record it below as `equivalent` with the
#            reason — or a test is missing. Assume the second until you have shown the first.
#
# Usage:  scripts/mutate.sh            run every mutation
#         scripts/mutate.sh audit      run those whose description matches "audit"

# Each mutation is a function call, not a delimited string. The first version of this
# script parsed `file|tests|expectation|expr|description` with IFS='|', and the very
# first permission-engine mutation contained `||` — which split into empty fields and
# fed sed a truncated expression. A separator that can appear in the data is not a
# separator.
#
# `expectation` is `killed` for a mutation the suite must catch, or `equivalent` for one
# it provably cannot because the change has no observable effect. An `equivalent` entry
# must carry its reason in the description — otherwise it is indistinguishable from a gap
# somebody gave up on.
